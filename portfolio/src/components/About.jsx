          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>🎓 Hi, I am a B.Tech. student in Electronics and Computer Engineering at VIT Chennai.
            I enjoy working with both hardware and software, and I have experience in Python,
            Java, and full-stack development, especially using the MERN stack.<br/>
            🛠️ Recently, I have started exploring Flutter, and I am excited to dive deeper into 
            it. I am always looking for new opportunities to apply what I have learned, solve
            real-world problems, and grow professionally.<br/>
            ⚡ Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests or know of 
            opportunities where I can contribute!</p>
